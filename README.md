# UE5 Benchmark

- This is source & content for a simple Unreal Engine 5.4 benchmark application.
- Fab content + Camera on a spline + Some code = Benchmark application.
- At the end of the benchmark the results are stored in `BenchmarkResults.txt`.
- Made in a few days without knowing anything about UE.
- You'll need to purchase the Cave Ruins content if you want to rebuild the project.
